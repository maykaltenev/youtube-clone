### About Project

This project is part of the Digital Career Institute curriculum. It is mend to implement the basic and advance HTML & CSS approaches that we covered during the first month of the journey. The layout is made with grid and the inside arrangements are made with flexbox. I implemented a little mouseover effect with JavaScript.
